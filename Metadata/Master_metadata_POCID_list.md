***ID:*** Project name identification.  

***Replicate:*** Number of tubes for molecular work.  

***Data:*** Link to replicate it's the number of tubes for the principal DNA tube.   

***Backup*** Link to replicate it's the number of tubes for the Backup DNA tube. Du of the size of the recruit it can happen that the sample don't have Backup tube.  

***Quantity DNA RNA Shield Data (ml):*** Quantity of DNA/RNA shield added to teh tubes (principal).   

***Quantity DNA RNA Shield Backup (ml):*** Quantity of DNA/RNA shield added to teh tubes (Backup).   

***Box name Data:*** Name of the box containing DNA of the principal sample.  

***Box name Backup:*** Name of the box containing DNA of the Backup sample.   

***Freezer US:*** Localisation of the samples in the freezer.  

***Freezer backup moorea:*** Localisation of the samples in the freezer.   

***Whirlpak:*** Designe if the during the process of adding piece of coral (DNA) we have piece of fragment left for the next step (SEM).
